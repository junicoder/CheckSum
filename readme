# Internet Checksum (Binary Input) Simulator

A Python -based simulator for computing and verifying checksums in binary data transmission. This project is designed to help understand how checksums are used to ensure data integrity during transmission.

## Project Overview

This project simulates the process of transmitting binary data and uses checksums to detect errors that may occur during transmission. It includes functionalities to:
- Convert binary strings to byte vectors.
- Compute checksums.
- Simulate errors in data transmission.
- Verify data integrity using checksums.

## Section

- **Section**: V4

## Features

- **Binary to Bytes Conversion**: Converts binary input strings into a list of bytes.
- **Checksum Computation**: Computes the checksum for a given set of bytes.
- **Error Simulation**: Simulates random bit errors in the transmitted data.
- **Data Integrity Verification**: Verifies the integrity of the received data using checksums.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the Python script in a Python environment.
2. **Enter Binary Data**: Input a binary string when prompted.
3. **View Results**: The program will display the steps of the transmission simulation, including the original input, converted bytes, computed checksum, and verification results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries required

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python checksum_simulator.py
   ```

## Example Usage

1. Start the program.
2. Choose the option to enter binary data.
3. Input a binary string, e.g., `0100100001100101`.
4. View the simulation steps and results.
